Those Who are getting segmentation fault in C/C++

We can only use maximum of 10^5 continuous memory at a time(local) but here size of the N is 10^6 which exceed the limit ...that's why we are getting segmentation fault ...so simple solution is use vector in place of array .

------ Min / Max Heap -----
priority_queue <int> pq; // by default max heap
to implement it as a min heap push negative of element every time of push operation
